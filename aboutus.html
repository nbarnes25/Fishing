	<p>Nathan's Fishing Charters is a locally owned business founded by Nathan Barnes in 2021. Nathan has spent decades fishing the waters of world renowned Leech Lake and has many impressive catches to show and stories to tell. The boat used for every fishing trip is a 2018 17ft Ranger fiberglass bass boat that sits up to 4 people and is equipped with a 150 horse power mercury motor. /p>
